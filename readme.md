## Event Page 
- static page that displays information about an event (conference, webinar, product launch, etc.).
-  The schedule, the event location, and the speakers' names and photographs with links will all be in the header section.
-  A section describing the event's goal, including who the event is for and whose audience group it is intended to reach, must also be included
-  To make the page look clean, divide it into smaller sections.
-  Select the appropriate background colour, font style, and color for each component of the page.

## things i learn during this project

1. always catergorize 
    - let say while starting a project always make a map in your mind before executing
    - catergorize in different section for better understanding

2. how to use emmet in vscode?
    - help to wrap and remove html element fast 
    - learned shortcut to create differenct element with ease like to create three `<a>` a.item$*5 help to create five anchor tags
  
3. small concept but helpful?
   1. how to create enlarge font while hover on them to look asthetic  `a:hover{font-size: 1.2em; }`
   2. use case of **margin and padding** 
        margin = apply margin to a <div> element to create a gap between it and the surrounding elements.
        padding =  apply padding to a <div> element to add space between its content and the border.
   3. Implementation anchor tag redirect to another section of page? in anchor tag denote section starts with # `#name` when us call it just add respective element id with same name `id="name"`
   4. Block Element Center Alignment:
        For block-level elements (like `<div>, <p>, or <h1>`), you can set the margin property to "0 auto" along with a defined width. This will center-align the block element within its parent container. For example:
        ```
            .center-align {
            margin: 0 auto;
            width: 50%; /* Adjust the width as per your requirement */
            }
        ```
